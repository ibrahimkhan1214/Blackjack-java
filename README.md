# Blackjack-java
Game of Blackjack in java

This is a game between player and dealer(computer)

The dealer choices are governed by the probability of getting a bust or not.
I used probability to add a touch of dealer making smarter decisions in the game and not just hard coding dealer's decisions.

Game Rules:
 * First, it's the player's turn. The player can decide to hit or stay.
 *  hit: draw another card.
    stay: do nothing.

 *  If the player decides to hit, and their hand value exceeds 21, they go bust (lose).

 *   Once the player decides to stay, the dealer reveals the hidden card.

 *  Then, the dealer must hit until their cards total up to 17. At 17 points or higher, the dealer can choose to hit or stay.

 *   You win if your hand value is higher than the dealer's hand.

 *   You win if the dealer goes bust (exceeds 21)

 *   You lose if the dealer's hand value is higher than yours.
